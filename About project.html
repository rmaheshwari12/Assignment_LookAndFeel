    <h2>Responsiveness </h2>
    <p>
        We have checked compatibility with small (mobile), medium (tablet) and large (desktop) screen sizes. Website works fine with all screen sizes.
        To do that we have added meta tag for viewpoint which fixes the pages for different screen sizes.
    </p>
    <h2>Usability </h2>
    <p>
        We have added proper navigation menus for ease of access. We have created separate navigation tabs at the top for Home, Course Information,
        Students and faculty e-Profiles, GitHub link and About Project page.
    </p>
    <h2>Content </h2>
    <p>
        On the landing page there is a brief  introduction of what an e-Portfolio is, along with a short video on wht it is important to the right.
        We have created 3 e-Portfolios for students (team members) and a short intro for the faculty and GA. Nowadays, e-Portfolios are very important. 
        They provide a great platform for both students and faculty to learn about achievement of important outcomes over time,
        keep information in one place, make connections among disparate parts of the curriculum, gain insights leading to improvement, and development of
        identities as learners or as facilitators.
    </p>

    <h2>Design </h2>
    <p>
        There are several design guidlines that needs to be followed when making a website.
        After finalizing a topic, the team sat together to design each weg page individually.
        Along the way we made sure of the following quidelines among others:
        <ul>
            <li>Adding proper line spaces and indentation wherever required for better readability</li>
            <li>Having closing tags for all the tags for better coding </li>
            <li>Using lowercase attribute names</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Learnings</h2>
    <p>
        It was a great experience to work on a project ike this as it required to think creatively
        along with technically and logically.
        It helped us look at the bigger picture and in the process create several small modules of the
        Assignment
        It took as about 20 hours of work:
        Topic selection : 1 hour
        Design : 3 hours:
        Html basics: 3 hours
        coding : 10 hours
        Testing and integration: 3 hours
        For the future assignments, such assignments that require thinking at the design and architecture level
        Would really help us through the course.
