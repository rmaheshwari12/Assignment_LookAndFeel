    <h2>Distributed Information System</h2>

    <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
    <p>
        The goal of the course is to teach students full stack development using modern frameworks and understand how the various components
        of these applications communicate with each other. Students will develop familiarity with
        using contemporary development tools and deploying full stack applications to the cloud.
        Given the business analytics focus of the program, projects and exercises will focus on helping
        students gain familiarity with using data collections and APIs.Every graduate course in every business
        school has one primary motivation: why should anyone follow you? The projects and exercises in the class are
        therefore designed to help students develop confidence in their own technical and leadership capabilities so they can
        inspire confidence in team members and clients about their ability to develop technology solutions to address business problems.
