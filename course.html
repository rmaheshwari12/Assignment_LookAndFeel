<h2>Distributed Information System</h2>


<h3>Course Objectives</h3>
<p>The goal of the course is to teach students full stack development using modern frameworks and understand how the various components 
of these applications communicate with each other. Students will develop familiarity with 
using contemporary development tools and deploying full stack applications to the cloud. 
Given the business analytics focus of the program, projects and exercises will focus on helping 
students gain familiarity with using data collections and APIs.Every graduate course in every business
 school has one primary motivation: why should anyone follow you? The projects and exercises in the class are
 therefore designed to help students develop confidence in their own technical and leadership capabilities so they can 
 inspire confidence in team members and clients about their ability to develop technology solutions to address business problems.<p>
